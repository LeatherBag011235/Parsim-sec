      "Basis of Presentation and Preparation\n",
      "The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).\n",
      "The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\n",

      "The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\n",
      "As of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in greater than three years.\n",

      "Derivative Instruments and Hedging\n",
      "The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\n",
      "Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\n",
      "To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\n",
      "To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\n",
      "The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\n",

      "The Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 34% and 41% of total trade receivables as of December 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\n",
      "Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\n",
      "The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n",

The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n",

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store®. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”). On January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court denied both the Company’s and Epic’s petitions and the stay terminated. The Supreme Court’s denial of Epic’s petition confirms the District Court’s ruling in favor of the Company with respect to all of the antitrust claims. Following termination of the stay, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the District Court. On January 31, 2024, Epic filed a notice with the District Court indicating its intent to dispute the Company’s compliance plan.\n",

On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the U.S. of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra™ 2. The Company subsequently proposed a redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”) and appealed the Order. On January 12, 2024, the CBP found that the Company’s proposed redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 falls outside the scope of the Order, permitting the Company to import and sell the models in the U.S.\n",

If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n",
      "Item 1A.    Risk Factors\n",
      "The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K.\n",
      "The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n",
      "From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\n",
      "Apple Inc. | Q1 2024 Form 10-Q | 19\n",
      "In January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari® in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it is still subject to potential challenge by the European Commission or private litigants. In addition, other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the European Union are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses to European Union users, many risks will remain.\n",
      "The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n",
      "Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n",
      "There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n",

      "(1)As of December 30, 2023, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 4, 2023, of which $36.4 billion had been utilized. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\n",
      "(2)In August 2023, the Company entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”) to purchase up to a total of $5.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In October 2023, the purchase periods for these ASRs ended and an additional 6 million shares were delivered and retired. In total, 29 million shares were delivered under these ASRs at an average repurchase price of $174.93 per share.\n",
