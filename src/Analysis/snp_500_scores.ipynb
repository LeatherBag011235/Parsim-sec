these notes we us our BrownForman and the Company refer to BrownForman Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements We prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for interim financial information In accordance with those rules and regulations we condensed or omitted certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP In our opinion the accompanying financial statements include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments unless otherwise indicated necessary for a fair statement of our financial results for the periods presented in these financial statements The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of future or annual resultsWe suggest that you read these condensed financial statements together with the financial statements and footnotes included in our Annual Report on Form for the fiscal year ended April Form Except for adopting the new accounting standards discussed below we prepared the accompanying financial statements on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Form adopted accounting standards As of May we adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates ASUs issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board benefit plans The guidance requires the service cost component of the NPC to be reported in the income statement in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period The other components of the NPC are to be presented separately from the service cost and outside of income from operations In addition the guidance allows only the service cost component of NPC to be eligible for capitalization when applicable We applied the guidance retrospectively for the presentation in the income statement and prospectively for the capitalization of service cost The retrospective application increased previouslyreported operating income by million and million for the three and nine months ended January respectively As the retrospective application merely reclassified amounts from operating income to nonoperating expense there was no effect on previouslyreported net income or earnings per shareNew accounting standards to be adopted We will adopt the following ASUs as of May continue to make progress in implementing the new standard We continue to evaluate and collect data about our lease arrangements are in the process of implementing a new lease accounting system and are identifying and making other changes to our processes and controls to meet the requirements of the new standard Although we are unable to quantify the impact of adoption at this time the amount of lease liabilities and rightofuse assets to be recognized on our balance sheet could be material We do not currently expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations stockholders equity or cash flowsWe will adopt ASC as of May using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at that date For the transition we expect to elect to use the package of practical expedients to not reassess a whether existing contracts are or contain leases b the classification of existing leases and c initial direct costs for existing leasesThere are no other new accounting standards to be adopted that we currently believe might have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statementsReclassifications We have reclassified some previously reported expense amounts related to certain marketing research and promotional agency costs to conform to the current year classification These immaterial reclassifications between advertising expenses and selling general and administrative expenses had no impact on operating income or net Net Sales Effective May we updated our policy for recognizing revenue net sales to reflect the adoption of ASC We describe the updated policy below Also we show how the adoption impacted our financial statements and we present disaggregated net sales information in accordance with the new standardRevenue recognition policy Our net sales predominantly reflect global sales of beverage alcohol consumer products We sell these products under contracts with different types of customers depending on the market The customer is most often a distributor wholesaler or retailerEach contract typically includes a single performance obligation to transfer control of the products to the customer Depending on the contract control is transferred when the products are either shipped or delivered to the customer at which point we recognize the transaction price for those products as net sales The transaction price recognized at that point reflects our estimate of the consideration to be received in exchange for the products The actual amount may ultimately differ due to the effect of various customer incentives and trade promotion activities In making our estimates we consider our historical and current expectations as applicable Adjustments recognized during the three and nine months ended January for changes in estimated transaction prices of products sold in prior periods were not material Net sales exclude taxes we collect from customers that are imposed by various governments on our sales and are reduced by payments to customers unless made in exchange for distinct goods or services with fair values approximating the paymentsNet sales include any amounts we bill customers for shipping and handling activities related to the products We recognize the cost of those activities in cost of sales during the same period in which we recognize the related net salesSales returns which are permitted only in limited situations are not materialCustomer payment terms generally range from to days There are no significant amounts of contract assets or liabilitiesImpact of adoption We adopted ASC using the modified retrospective method As a result we recorded an adjustment that decreased retained earnings as of May by million net of tax The adjustment reflects the cumulative effect on that date of applying our updated revenue recognition policy under which we recognize the cost of certain customer incentives earlier than we did before adopting ASC Although we do not expect this change in timing to have a significant impact on a fullyear basis there is some change in the timing of recognition across periods Additionally some payments to customers that we classified as expenses before adopting the new standard are classified as reductions of net sales under our new policy The following table shows how the adoption of ASC impacted our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended January following table shows how the adoption of ASC impacted our consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended January following table shows how the adoption of ASC impacted our consolidated balance sheet as of January revenues The following table shows our net sales by net sales of branded products to advanced economies as defined by the International Monetary Fund IMF excluding the United States Our largest developed international markets are the United Kingdom Australia and net sales of branded products to emerging and developing economies as defined by the IMF Our largest emerging markets are Mexico and net sales of branded products to global dutyfree customers travel retail customers and the US military regardless of customer net sales of used barrels bulk whiskey and wine and contract bottling regardless of customer locationThe following table shows our net sales by product all whiskey spirits and whiskeybased flavored liqueurs readytodrink and readytopour products The brands included in this category are the Jack Daniels family of brands Woodford Reserve Canadian Mist GlenDronach BenRiach Glenglassaugh Old Forester Early Times Slane Irish Whiskey and Coopers el Jimador Herradura New Mix Pepe Lopez and Korbel Champagne and SonomaCutrer net sales of used barrels bulk whiskey and wine and contract bottling regardless of customer Income TaxesOur consolidated interim effective tax rate is based on our expected annual operating income statutory tax rates and income tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate Significant or unusual items including adjustments to accruals for tax uncertainties are recognized in the fiscal quarter in which the related event or a change in judgment occurs The effective tax rate of for the nine months ended January is lower than the expected tax rate of on ordinary income for the full fiscal year primarily due to a the impact of discrete items including trueups to prior year tax returns b the impact of the current year net adjustment to the provisional repatriation US tax charge that was made during fiscal discussed below and c excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation Our expected tax rate includes current fiscal year additions for existing tax contingency items We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between and based on the tax rate of on ordinary income for the full fiscal year adjusted for known discrete itemsOn December the US government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act The Tax Act significantly revised the future ongoing US corporate income tax by among other things lowering US corporate income tax rates and implementing a territorial tax system As we have an April fiscal yearend the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in resulting in a US statutory federal rate of for our fiscal year ended April and for our current and subsequent fiscal years For the nine months ended January the reduction of the US statutory federal rate from the preTax Act rate to resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million There were also certain transitional impacts of the Tax Act As part of the transition to the new territorial tax system the Tax Act imposed a onetime repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries In addition we adjusted our US deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of million for the year ended April comprising of a provisional repatriation US tax charge of million and a provisional net deferred tax benefit of million In the nine months ended January we recorded a benefit of million as an adjustment to the provisional repatriation taxThe Tax Act also established new tax laws that impact our financial statements beginning in the current fiscal year These new laws include but are not limited to a Global Intangible LowTax Income GILTI a new inclusion rule affecting nonroutine income earned by foreign subsidiaries b Base Erosion Antiabuse Tax BEAT a new minimum tax c ForeignDerived Intangible Income FDII a new preferential tax rate for domestic income earned from serving foreign markets d repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and e limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation For the nine months ended January the net impact of these provisions was approximately million of additional taxAs noted certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries must be included in US taxable income under the GILTI provisions The FASB allows an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years deferred method or recognize such taxes as a current period expense when incurred period cost method We have elected to account for GILTI using the period cost methodHistorically we have asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely outside the United States Therefore no income taxes have been provided for any outside basis differences inherent in these subsidiaries other than those subject to the onetime repatriation tax As of October we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to current year earnings and prior year undistributed earnings for one of those foreign subsidiaries but not for its other outside basis differences and repatriated approximately million of cash to the United States from this subsidiary during the fiscal quarter ended January No incremental taxes are due on this distribution of cash beyond the repatriation tax recorded in fiscal year As of January we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to current year earnings and prior year undistributed earnings for additional select foreign subsidiaries but not outside basis differences Although these earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested and may now be distributed within our foreign entity structure they remain indefinitely reinvested outside the United States No deferred taxes have been recorded as no withholding taxes would be due on their distribution Also any income tax related to foreign exchange fluctuations that would be due on the distribution of these earnings would be subject to the GILTI provisions and be recorded as incurred We have not changed the indefinite reinvestment assertion on the undistributed earnings or other outside basis differences of any of our other remaining foreign subsidiaries and no deferred taxes have been provided The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex The SEC issued rules that allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts As of January the amounts recorded for the Tax Act for the onetime repatriation tax and the adjustment to our US deferred tax assets and liabilities have been finalized and are no longer deemed to be Earnings Per Share We calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted earnings per share further includes the dilutive effect of stockbased compensation awards We calculate that dilutive effect using the treasury stock method as defined by GAAPThe following table presents information concerning basic and diluted earnings per shareWe excluded common stockbased awards for approximately shares and shares from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January and respectively We excluded common stockbased awards for approximately shares and shares from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended January and respectively We excluded those awards because they were not dilutive for those periods under the treasury stock Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market Some of our consolidated inventories are valued using the lastin firstout LIFO method which we use for the majority of our US inventories If the LIFO method had not been used inventories at current cost would have been million higher than reported as of April and million higher than reported as of January Changes in the LIFO valuation reserve for interim periods are based on a proportionate allocation of the estimated change for the entire fiscal Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsThe following table shows the changes in goodwill which includes no accumulated impairment losses and other intangible assets during the nine months ended January other intangible assets consist of trademarks and brand names all with indefinite useful Commitments and ContingenciesWe operate in a litigious environment and we are sued in the normal course of business Sometimes plaintiffs seek substantial damages Significant judgment is required in predicting the outcome of these suits and claims many of which take years to adjudicate We accrue estimated costs for a contingency when we believe that a loss is probable and we can make a reasonable estimate of the loss and then adjust the accrual as appropriate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances We do not believe it is reasonably possible that these existing loss contingencies individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity No material accrued loss contingencies were recorded as of January have guaranteed the repayment by a thirdparty importer of its obligation under a bank credit facility that it uses in connection with its importation of our products in Russia If the importer were to default on that obligation which we believe is unlikely our maximum possible exposure under the existing terms of the guaranty would be approximately million subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates Both the fair value and carrying amount of the guaranty are insignificantAs of January our actual exposure under the guaranty of the importers obligation was approximately million We also have accounts receivable from that importer of approximately million at January which we expect to collect in fullBased on the financial support we provide to the importer we believe it meets the definition of a variable interest entity However because we do not control this entity it is not included in our consolidated financial DebtOur longterm debt net of unamortized discount and issuance costs consists ofAs of April our shortterm borrowings consisted of million of commercial paper with an average interest rate of and an average remaining maturity of days As of January our shortterm borrowings consisted of million of commercial paper with an average interest rate of and an average remaining maturity of Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basisFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date We categorize the fair values of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions inputs used to determine those values Level provides the most reliable measure of fair value while Level generally requires significant management judgment The three levels areWe determine the fair values of our currency derivatives forward contracts using standard valuation models The significant inputs used in these models which are readily available in public markets or can be derived from observable market transactions include the applicable spot exchange rates forward exchange rates and interest rates These fair value measurements are categorized as Level within the valuation hierarchyWe determine the fair value of longterm debt primarily based on the prices at which identical or similar debt has recently traded in the market and also considering the overall market conditions on the date of valuation These fair value measurements are categorized as Level within the valuation hierarchyThe fair values of cash cash equivalents and shortterm borrowings approximate the carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instrumentsWe measure some assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis That is we do not measure them at fair value on an ongoing basis but we do adjust them to fair value in some circumstances for example when we determine that an asset is impaired No material nonrecurring fair value measurements were required during the periods presented in these financial Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesOur multinational business exposes us to global market risks including the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates We use derivatives to help manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business We formally document the purpose of each derivative contract which includes linking the contract to the financial exposure it is designed to mitigate We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposesWe use currency derivative contracts to limit our exposure to the currency exchange risk that we cannot mitigate internally by using netting strategies We designate most of these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions expected to occur within three years We record all changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges except any ineffective portion in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI until the underlying hedged transaction occurs at which time we reclassify that amount into earnings We assess the effectiveness of these hedges based on changes in forward exchange rates The ineffective portion of the changes in fair value of our hedges recognized immediately in earnings during the periods presented in these financial statements was not materialWe had outstanding currency derivatives related primarily to our euro British pound and Australian dollar exposures with notional amounts totaling million at April and million at January also use foreign currencydenominated debt to help manage our currency exchange risk As of January million of our foreign currencydenominated debt instruments were designated as net investment hedges These net investment hedges are intended to mitigate foreign exchange exposure related to nonUS dollar net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries Any change in value of the designated portion of the hedging instruments is recorded in AOCI offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also recorded in AOCI There was no ineffectiveness related to our net investment hedges in any of the periods presented in these financial statementsWe do not designate some of our currency derivatives and foreign currencydenominated debt as hedges because we use them to at least partially offset the immediate earnings impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on existing assets or liabilities We immediately recognize the change in fair value of these instruments in earningsWe use forward purchase contracts with suppliers to protect against corn price volatility We expect to physically take delivery of the corn underlying each contract and use it for production over a reasonable period of time Accordingly we account for these contracts as normal purchases rather than as derivative following tables present the pretax impact that changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments and nonderivative hedging instruments had on AOCI and earningsWe expect to reclassify million of deferred net gains on cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI as of January to earnings during the next months This reclassification would offset the anticipated earnings impact of the underlying hedged exposures The actual amounts that we ultimately reclassify to earnings will depend on the exchange rates in effect when the underlying hedged transactions occur As of January the maximum term of our outstanding derivative contracts was following table presents the fair values of our derivative instrumentsThe fair values reflected in the above table are presented on a gross basis However as discussed further below the fair values of those instruments subject to net settlement agreements are presented on a net basis in our balance sheetsIn our statements of cash flows we classify cash flows related to cash flow hedges in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged itemsCredit risk We are exposed to creditrelated losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the contracts To manage this risk we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investmentgrade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA agreements that allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts Also we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored and we monetize contracts when we believe it is warranted Because of these safeguards we believe we have no derivative positions that warrant credit valuation adjustmentsSome of our derivative instruments require us to maintain a specific level of creditworthiness which we have maintained If our creditworthiness were to fall below that level then the counterparties to our derivative instruments could request immediate payment or collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with creditworthiness requirements that were in a net liability position was million at April and million at January As noted above our derivative contracts are governed by ISDA agreements that allow for net settlement of derivative contracts with the same counterparty It is our policy to present the fair values of current derivatives ie those with a remaining term of months or less with the same counterparty on a net basis in the balance sheet Similarly we present the fair values of noncurrent derivatives with the same counterparty on a net basis Current derivatives are not netted with noncurrent derivatives in the balance sheet following table summarizes the gross and net amounts of our derivative contractsNo cash collateral was received or pledged related to our derivative contracts as of April or January Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The following table shows the components of the net cost of pension and other postretirement benefits recognized for our US benefit plans Information about similar international plans is not presented due to

above for further details on the factors contributing to the growth in underlying net sales for the nine months ended January of sales for the three months ended January increased million or to million when compared to the same period last year Underlying cost of sales increased after adjusting reported costs for the positive effect of foreign exchange and an estimated net increase in distributor inventories The increase in underlying cost of sales for the three months ended January was driven by incremental costs associated with tariffs higher input costs of wood and agave and higher volumes We estimate that incremental costs associated with tariffs increased our underlying cost of sales growth by approximately eight percentage points Cost of sales for the nine months ended January increased million or to million when compared to the same period last year Underlying cost of sales increased after adjusting reported costs for the positive effect of foreign exchange and an estimated net increase in distributor inventories The increase in underlying cost of sales for the nine months ended January was driven by higher input costs including wood and agave incremental costs associated with tariffs and higher volumes We estimate that incremental costs associated with tariffs increased our underlying cost of sales growth by approximately three percentage points Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal we expect a input costs to increase in the high single digits largely due to higher cost of wood and agave and b incremental costs associated with include the combined effect of tariffrelated costs whether arising as a reduction of net sales or as an increase in cost of sales See Overview Tariffs for additional details of these costs Gross profit of million decreased million or for the three months ended January compared to the same period last year Underlying gross profit declined after adjusting reported results for the negative effect of foreign exchange and an estimated net increase in distributor inventories The decrease in underlying gross profit resulted from the same factors that contributed to the increase in underlying cost of sales including incremental costs associated with tariffs and higher input costs partially offset by an increase in underlying net salesFor the three months ended January gross margin decreased approximately percentage points to from in the same period last year driven by incremental costs associated with tariffs and an increase in input costs Gross profit of billion decreased million for the nine months ended January compared to the same period last year Underlying gross profit grew after adjusting reported results for a the negative effect of foreign exchange b the adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard and c an estimated net increase in distributor inventories The increase in underlying gross profit resulted from the same factors that contributed to the increase in underlying net sales and the increase in underlying cost of salesFor the nine months ended January gross margin decreased approximately percentage point to from in the same period last year driven by incremental costs associated with tariffs and an increase in input costs Operating expenses totaled million down million or for the three months ended January compared to the same period last year Underlying operating expenses declined after adjusting for the positive effect of foreign exchange and reclassifications related to the adoption of the revenue recognition accounting by the timing of spending on JDTF Korbel Champagne and Woodford Reserve These decreases were partially offset by higher spending on our tequila brands Operating expenses totaled million down million or for the nine months ended January compared to the same period last year Underlying operating expenses increased after adjusting for the positive effect of foreign exchange and reclassifications related to the adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standardOperating income of million increased million or for the three months ended January compared to the same period last year Underlying operating income also grew after adjusting for a the negative effect of foreign exchange b an estimated net increase in distributor inventories and c the adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard The increase in underlying operating income was due to a quarter over quarter decline in total underlying operating expenses partially offset by lower underlying gross profit growthFor the three months ended January operating margin increased percentage points to from in the same period last year The increase in our operating margin was driven by lower operating expenses partially offset by incremental costs associated with tariffs Operating income of million increased million or for the nine months ended January compared to the same period last year Underlying operating income grew after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange and an estimated net increase in distributor inventories The same factors that contributed to the growth in underlying gross profit also contributed to the growth in underlying operating income In addition a decrease in underlying SGA expenses also contributed to the underlying growth in operating income Operating margin decreased percentage points to for the nine months ended January from in the same period last year The decrease in our operating margin was due mainly to the decrease in underlying gross margin largely reflecting the incremental costs associated with tariffs partially offset by lower SGA expenses The effective tax rate in the three months ended January was compared to for the same period last year The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by beneficial changes in the discrete transitional impacts of the Tax Act and trueups to prior year tax returns partially offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationAs we have an April fiscal yearend the lower US corporate income tax rate prescribed by the Tax Act was phased in resulting in a US statutory federal rate of for the nine months ended January as well as our fiscal year ended April and for our current and subsequent fiscal years See Note to the accompanying financial statements for information The effective tax rate in the nine months ended January was compared to for the same period last year The decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by the reduction in the US statutory federal tax rate and a beneficial change in the discrete transitional impacts of the Tax Act These reductions were partially offset by the absence of the amortization of deferred tax benefit that was reclassified to retained earnings as a result of the application of ASU See Note to the accompanying financial statements for additional information A decrease in excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation also partially offset these reductions Diluted earnings per share of in the three months ended January increased from the reported for the same period last year Diluted earnings per share of in the nine months ended January increased from the reported for the same period last year The increase in diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended January resulted from the benefit of a lower effective tax rate from the Tax Act and an increase in reported operating income These benefits were partially offset by higher interest expense which resulted from a new bond issuance in March and higher nonoperating postretirement expense which resulted from the pension settlement and Financial ConditionCash flows Cash and cash equivalents increased million during the nine months ended January compared to an increase of million during the same period last year Cash provided by operations was million during the nine months ended January slightly changed from million for the same period last yearCash used for investing activities was million during the nine months ended January compared to million for the same period last year The million decline largely reflects an million reduction in payments for corporateowned life insurance and a million decrease in capital spendingCash used for financing activities was million during the nine months ended January compared to million for the same period last year The million increase largely reflects a million increase in share repurchases and a million decline in net proceeds from shortterm borrowings partially offset by a million reduction in repayments of longterm debtThe impact on cash and cash equivalents as a result of exchange rate changes was a decrease of million for the nine months ended January compared to an increase of million for the same period last yearLiquidity We continue to manage liquidity conservatively to meet current obligations fund capital expenditures sustain and grow our regular dividends and return cash to our shareholders from time to time through share repurchases and special dividends while reserving adequate debt capacity for acquisition opportunitiesIn addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances we have access to several liquidity sources to supplement our cash flow from operations One of those sources is our million commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund our shortterm credit needs During the three months ended January our commercial paper borrowings averaged million with an average maturity of days and an average interest rate of During the nine months ended January our commercial paper borrowings averaged million with an average maturity of days and an average interest rate of Commercial paper outstanding was million at April and million at January commercial paper program is supported by available commitments under our currently undrawn million bank credit facility that expires on November Although unlikely under extreme market conditions one or more participating banks may not be able to fully fund its commitments under our credit facility We believe the debt capital markets are accessible sources of longterm financing that could meet any additional liquidity needs We believe our current liquidity position is sufficient to meet all of our future financial commitments We have high credit standards when initiating transactions with counterparties and we closely monitor our counterparty risks with respect to our cash balances and derivative contracts If a counterpartys credit quality were to deteriorate below our credit standards we would expect either to liquidate exposures or require the counterparty to post appropriate collateralAs of January approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States As discussed in Note to the accompanying financial statements as of October we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion with respect to current year earnings and prior year undistributed earnings for one foreign subsidiary and repatriated approximately million of its cash to the United States during the fiscal quarter ended January No incremental taxes will be due on this distribution of cash beyond the repatriation tax recorded in fiscal We continue to evaluate our future cash deployment and may decide to repatriate additional cash held by other foreign subsidiaries to the United States Future repatriations to the United States may require us to provide for and pay additional taxesAs announced on January our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share on our Class A and Class B
